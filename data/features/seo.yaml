description: "In this version, instead of giving only the italicized version of the relevant shabad of the Hukam Nama, a full text is given both in Gurmukhi, and italicized English. The brief explanation of each shabad is copied from the author’s earlier publication of the complete interpretation of Sri Guru Granth Sahib, under the title “It is The Same Light” in seven volumes."
