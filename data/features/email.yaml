description: "I hope these quotes and stories from different religions and traditions would be enough to convince the readers that, even though religions may be different and diverse, in many respects, yet they all teach us to practice some basic good values and virtues, such as truth, honesty, love, compassion, and kindness, and avoid some obvious sins and evils, such as lust, anger, greed, ego, and slander. This is the unity in the diversity of different religions."
