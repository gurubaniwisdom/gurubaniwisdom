text: "A monumental undertaking, reflecting a lifetime of devotion to the Sri Guru GranthSahib and to the scholarly study of its voluminous texts. Both its rendition of the original Gurmukhi script, with accompanying English transliteration, and its erudite commentary on each of the Granthâ€™s many hymns mark this work as a stunning achievement which will benefit all serious students of the Sikh religion and of world religions in general."
