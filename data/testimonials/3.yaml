text: "Daljit Singh Jawa ji has clearly been chosen and blessed by God himself to contribute in his excellent translation of this priceless Divine expression (Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji) from Guru Sahib ji himself in 7 large volumes. Each page of this priceless Divine expression oozes of Divine nectar (ras) with conspicuous clarity of Guru Sahib's simple message for all souls who are going through different phases and stages in their lives. No doubt this special effort will last many ages to come as this divine message is relevant for all time frames and eras for all souls regardless of their background, ethnicity or nationality. Am blessed to have had the honor of reading the initial volumes of this Divine piece of work!"
