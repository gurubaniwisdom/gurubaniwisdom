text: "This translation of Guru Granth Sahib is one of the best English translations in my view, as it is in simple understandable English, each shabad’s summary message is given, there is connection between the shabads to reveal continuity of thought process in Guru ji’s message. Thanks to S Daljit Singh ji for the great work, which will benefit future generations understand Guru Ji’s message easily."
