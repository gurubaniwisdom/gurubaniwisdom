text: "A year ago I came across the Sikh scripture called Guru Granth Sahib (GGS). I couldn't believe my luck and I began my study of Sikhism. This scripture is over 500 years old and was written in a variety of different languages and dialects, in a poetry style. This makes translation difficult. There are a few translations into English but most of them are in archaic English or the language and grammar is incorrect. Mr Jawa has presented us with his translation and interpretation of the SGGS."
