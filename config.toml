It is more like a collection of hymns, which expresses the feelings of love and devotion of the Sikh Gurus for the Supreme Being, along with the similar yearnings and longings of the devotees and saints from many faiths including Hindus, Muslims, Yogis, and their various branches and subdivisions. The beauty of this 1430 page hymnal lies in the fact that while it spiritually connects the human mind to the original source of eternal bliss, at the same time it gives us practical advice to live in peace and harmony with our fellow human beings, and the environment.

Therefore, we should love our fellow human beings, and live in harmony as  members of one big family. We should worship, praise, and sing glories of: “The Same light” that created us all."
